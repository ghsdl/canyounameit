# Can You Name it

This project was made with my ðŸ§  in shorts. "Can You Name It" generates (sometimes shitty sometimes great) names depending on the user search and checks for domain name availibility.

# what i thought would happen 

+ Struggling with the animation
+ Enjoying CSS
+ Enjoying the result 
+ Having fun coding on my own
+ Forgetting the responsive version

# what actually happened 

- I absolutely forgot the responsive version
- I did struggle with the animation but it looks good in the end, no glitchs
- Only took me a few hours which means i'm getting better at React basics

# what i learned from this project 

+ I enjoyed designing the app
+ Manipulating a package npm can be quite easy
+ Manipulating state is quite easy once you get the hang of useState
+ I love coding on my own on a chill sunday
+ React is powerful and props are automagic stuff
